## Uploading photos

Images can be uploaded to this repository by forking it and then uploading them to the appropriate directory.

To start, you need to make a new branch in your fork (do not use your master branch). You can do so by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).

Images must be in .png format, and be in numbered format, continuing off of what is already there (2.png, 3.png, 3.png, etc, etc).

When you have uploaded your images, open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) noting what you've added and the range of numbers you have added.

Your pull request will be reviewed as time is available, and space will be made as needed to fit the images in.

**Note**: Images that are not related to this repository, are not appropriate, or not suitable altogether, may be removed at maintainer's discretion.
